# NeuronMotif

This repository implements the methods in ["NeuronMotif: Deciphering cis-regulatory codes by layerwise de-mixing of deep neural networks"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.430606v1) by Zheng Wei, Kui Hua, Lei Wei, Shining Ma, Rui Jiang, Yanda Li, Wing Hung Wong, Xiaowo Wang.


The code for training deep convolutional neural network(DCNN) models that used in this work are stored in [dcnn](https://github.com/wzthu/NeuronMotif/tree/master/dcnn).

The code implements NeuronMotif alogrithm for decoupling the mentioned DCNN **once** are stored in [nm](https://github.com/wzthu/NeuronMotif/tree/master/nm). It also includes the interpreting and visualizing codes.

The code implements NeuronMotif alogrithm for decoupling the mentioned DCNN **twice** are stored in [nm-2](https://github.com/wzthu/NeuronMotif/tree/master/nm-2). It depends on the sequence sampling result that generated by the code in [nm](https://github.com/wzthu/NeuronMotif/tree/master/nm). It also includes the interpreting and visualizing codes. 
The code of NeuronMotif does not depend on GPU. We have parallelized the code so that it can make full use of the computing resources in a computer clusters.

If you are interested in a part of the work, you can read README file in corresponding folder for the instruction of  installation, downloading the data and running the code.

# Introduction of NeuronMotif

NeuronMotif is an algorithm for interpreting the patterns learned by deep convolutional neurons(DCN) in DCNN. For a DCNN based on DNA sequences, it can convert the substructure weight of a DCN into DNA sequence motifs. DNA can be considered a new language so the task of NeuronMotif is to uncover the motif and motif grammar embedded in DCNs.
