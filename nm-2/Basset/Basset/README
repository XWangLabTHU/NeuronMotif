For each layer do:
1. link the ppm files of layers

sh runlink.sh ../../../../nm/Basset/Basset/layer3 layer3 200

The parameter of runlink.sh:

1st, NeuronMotif result ppm directory xxx/xxx/xxx/layer?
2nd, layer?
3st, the number of the kernel

2 Download motif database

Take JASPAR as an example:

wget http://jaspar.genereg.net/download/CORE/JASPAR2020_CORE_vertebrates_redundant_pfms_meme.txt
mv JASPAR2020_CORE_vertebrates_redundant_pfms_meme.txt  motifDB.txt 

3. run tomtom

The parameter of run.layer.tt.sh:
1st, layer number, start from 1
2nd, kernels number in this layer
3rd, the max threads number to be used.
4th, is the model train by DeepSEA dataset, yes: 1, no: 0
It depends on total CPU cores in this computer and is limited by memory size.
Be carefule to set large threads. The memory is easy to be stuffed.

For example:

# 28 cores server 128GB memory


sh run.layer.tt.sh 3 200 20 0
